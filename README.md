+# Django Payroll System
+
+## Description
+
+This project is a comprehensive Payroll Management System built with Django. It aims to provide functionalities for managing employees, processing payroll, handling leave requests, IOU (I Owe You) applications, performance reviews, and maintaining an audit trail of actions within the system. The system is designed with role-based access control to ensure data security and appropriate access levels for different user types (e.g., HR, regular employees, superusers).
+
+## Features
+
+*   **Employee Management:**
+    *   Add, update, view, and delete employee profiles.
+    *   Soft delete functionality for employee records.
+    *   Employee search and filtering by department.
+    *   Manage employee departments.
+    *   Store detailed employee information including personal details, job information, bank details, emergency contacts, and next of kin.
+*   **Payroll Processing:**
+    *   Define and manage payroll components (basic salary, allowances, deductions).
+    *   Calculate gross income, taxable income, and net pay.
+    *   Manage pay periods (PayT).
+    *   Generate payslips for employees.
+    *   Generate various payroll reports (Bank reports, NHIS, NHF, PAYE, Pension).
+*   **Leave Management:**
+    *   Employees can apply for leave.
+    *   HR can manage (approve/reject) leave requests.
+    *   Define and view leave policies.
+    *   Employees can view their leave request history.
+*   **IOU (I Owe You) Management:**
+    *   Employees can request IOUs.
+    *   HR can manage (approve/reject) IOU applications.
+    *   Track IOU status (Pending, Approved, Rejected, Paid).
+    *   Employees can view their IOU history.
+*   **Performance Reviews:**
+    *   Add, update, view, and delete employee performance reviews.
+    *   Track review date, rating, and comments.
+*   **Dashboards:**
+    *   Admin dashboard for superusers.
+    *   HR dashboard with key metrics (total employees, pending approvals) and quick links to approval sections.
+    *   User-specific dashboard.
+*   **Security & Access Control:**
+    *   Login required for most views.
+    *   Permission-based access control for different functionalities (e.g., HR can manage employees, employees can view their own profiles).
+*   **Audit Trail:**
+    *   Log important actions performed by users (e.g., creating, updating, deleting records).
+    *   View and filter audit logs.
+*   **User Management:**
+    *   Integration with Django's `CustomUser` model.
+    *   Automatic creation of `EmployeeProfile` upon `CustomUser` creation.
+

+*   **HR Personnel:**
+    *   View and manage employee profiles (`payroll.view_employeeprofile`, `payroll.add_employeeprofile`, `payroll.change_employeeprofile`, `payroll.delete_employeeprofile`).
+    *   Manage leave requests (`payroll.change_leaverequest`).
+    *   Manage IOU applications (`payroll.change_iou`).

+
+## Models Overview
